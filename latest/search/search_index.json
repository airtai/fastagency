For developers who use the AutoGen framework, FastAgency enables you to seamlessly scale Jupyter notebook prototypes into fully functional, production-ready applications. With multi-framework support, a unified programming interface, and powerful API integration capabilities, FastAgency streamlines the deployment process, saving time and effort while maintaining flexibility and performance.</p> <p>Whether you're orchestrating complex AI agents or integrating external APIs into workflows, FastAgency provides the tools necessary to quickly transition from concept to production, reducing development cycles and allowing you to focus on optimizing your multi-agent systems.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Multi-Runtime Support: FastAgency supports multiple agentic runtimes to provide maximum flexibility. Currently, it supports AutoGen and plans to extend support to CrewAI. This ensures that as the AI ecosystem evolves, FastAgency remains a reliable and adaptable framework, capable of leveraging emerging agentic technologies. Developers can easily switch between frameworks, choosing the best one for their project's specific needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unified Programming Interface Across UIs: FastAgency features a common programming interface that enables you to develop your core workflows once and reuse them across various user interfaces without rewriting code. This includes support for both console-based applications via <code>ConsoleUI</code> and web-based applications via <code>MesopUI</code>. Whether you need a command-line tool or a fully interactive web app, FastAgency allows you to deploy the same underlying workflows across environments, saving development time and ensuring consistency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Seamless External API Integration: One of FastAgency's standout features is its ability to easily integrate external APIs into your agent workflows. With just a single line of code, you can import an OpenAPI specification, and in only one more line, you can connect it to your agents. This dramatically simplifies the process of enhancing AI agents with real-time data, external processing, or third-party services. For example, you can easily integrate a weather API to provide dynamic, real-time weather updates to your users, making your application more interactive and useful with minimal effort.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tester Class for Continuous Integration: FastAgency also provides a Tester Class that enables developers to write and execute tests for their multi-agent workflows. This feature is crucial for maintaining the reliability and robustness of your application, allowing you to automatically verify agent behavior and interactions. The Tester Class is designed to integrate smoothly with continuous integration (CI) pipelines, helping you catch bugs early and ensure that your workflows remain functional as they scale into production.</p> </li> <li> <p>Command-Line Interface (CLI) for Orchestration: FastAgency includes a powerful command-line interface (CLI) for orchestrating and managing multi-agent applications directly from the terminal. The CLI allows developers to quickly run workflows, pass parameters, and monitor agent interactions without needing a full GUI. This is especially useful for automating deployments and integrating workflows into broader DevOps pipelines, enabling developers to maintain control and flexibility in how they manage AI-driven applications.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"user-guide/#why-fastagency","title":"Why FastAgency?","text":"<p>FastAgency bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and production-ready deployment, empowering developers to bring their multi-agent systems to life quickly and efficiently.

This helps the client differentiate between different types of messages and handle them accordingly. Let\u2019s break them down into two categories:</p> <p>Messages for Display:</p> <ul> <li><code>text_message</code>: A basic text message from the server, intended for display to the user. It doesn\u2019t require any action from the user, serving purely as information or status updates.</li> <li><code>workflow_started</code>: This message indicates the start of a new workflow. The message includes the workflow\u2019s name and a description along with other details.</li> <li><code>workflow_completed</code>: This message signals that the current workflow has been successfully completed. The client can use this to notify the user or transition to the next step in the application.</li> <li><code>suggested_function_call</code>: Indicates that the LLM has suggested a function call.</li> <li><code>function_call_execution</code>: Indicates that the LLM has executed the suggested function call.</li> <li><code>error</code>: Indicates that an error occurred during the workflow. The client can handle this by displaying an error message or prompting the user to retry the action.</li> </ul> <p>Messages That Require User Response:</p> <ul> <li><code>text_input</code>: This message prompts the client to gather input from the user. It could be a question or request for data. The client should provide a way for the user to respond (e.g., a text input or text area) and then send the response back to the server.</li> <li><code>multiple_choice</code>: This message requires the user to choose from a predefined set of options provided by the LLM. The client should present these options (e.g., checkboxes or radio buttons) and submit the user\u2019s selection back to the server.</li> </ul> <p>A full list of message types and their detailed usage will be available soon in the FastAgency Adapter\u2019s OpenAPI specification\u2014stay tuned!</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/adapters/fastapi/#implementation-guide","title":"Implementation Guide","text":"<p>In the following sections, we'll walk through the process of creating a custom client application that implements the flow we've just described.
